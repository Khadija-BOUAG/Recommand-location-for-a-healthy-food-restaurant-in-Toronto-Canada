    "from 2007 to 2014, and it is always increasing until now! In fact, it is due to many reasons including the lack of restaurants wich provide healthy food.\n",
    "\n",
    "and normally to open a restaurant you must garanty accessibility and visibility, i mean a near parking and a high foot or car traffic is an ideal requirement, and it is hard to do that manualy, whereas if it is done with ML it will requires just a dataset and some processsing on it !\n"
